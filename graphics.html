          <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="subtitle">
          <p>For about a year, I worked as a graphic designer for SHEI Magazine, the University of Michigan's most popular fashion publication. I was tasked with creating 2-6 page spreads of either written content or photoshoots, and I was given a lot of freedom to be creative with how I wanted to lay out each page. As a writer for the Michigan Daily's Michigan in Color section, I designed nearly every graphic for each article I wrote. Below are a few of my favorite works that I've designed for both publications.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>SHEI Magazine</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="css/resources/images/addiction_spread1.jpg" alt="First spread for the photoshoot 'Addiction' featuring a large group photo of all the models together">
            <img src="css/resources/images/addiction_spread2.jpg" alt="Second spread for the photoshoot 'Addiction' featuring a photos of the individual and and groups of models laid on top of a large group photo of all the models' hands">
            <p class='text'>This layout was for the photoshoot "Addiction," and I immediately fell in love with the colors and the mixing of different textures of the backgrounds when I saw the photos. I decided to play up the psychadelic nature of the photos by creating text in illustrator and creating motions blurs in photoshop. I also sourced colors from the images to create semi-transparent borders overlaying the photos.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="css/resources/images/grass_is_greener_spread1.jpg" alt="First spread for the photoshoot 'The Grass is Always Greener' featuring a MacOS Desktop display with all the photos from the shoot as shortcut icons and an iMessage window open with the main image sent as an attachment">
            <img src="css/resources/images/grass_is_greener_spread2.jpg" alt="Second spread for the photoshoot 'The Grass is Always Greener' featuring another MacOS Desktop display with a few images open on top of a background image that was another photo from the shoot">
            <p class='text'>This is my favorite layout that I've done because I had a really strong vision for the design from the outset. Several images I received from the photograph contained photoshopped iMessages overlayed on the photos, so I decided to design the pages around a desktop homepage. I even included small details like including the staff credits inside of the iMessage client.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="css/resources/images/reflections_and_refractions.jpg" alt="Spread for the written article 'Reflections and Refractions'">
            <img src="css/resources/images/fashion_for_every_body.jpg" alt="Spread for the written article 'Fashion for Every Body'">
            <p tabindex=0 class='text'>Both of these layouts were for written works, which I can often find challenging because the page must be interesting enough to capture the reader's attention while still ensuring that the text is readable. I achieve this balance by styling the title to grab the reader's attention and filling white space with different design elements and colors. It is also easy to find inspiration in the written text of the story, so that typically guides my design process.</p>

            <img src="css/resources/images/lost_in_time_spread1.jpg" alt="First spread for the photoshoot 'Lost in Time' featuring a large background photo of a women running up a street">
            <img src="css/resources/images/lost_in_time_spread2.jpg" alt="Second spread for the photoshoot 'Lost in Time' featuring a collage of photos from the shoot">
            <img src="css/resources/images/lost_in_time_spread3.jpg" id='finalimg' alt="Third spread for the photoshoot 'Lost in Time' featuring a collage of photos from the shoot">
            <p tabindex=0 class='text' id="finaltext">This spread is the longest one I've designed because it contained both a story and photos. Because of the title "Lost in Time," I wanted to create a collage to channel that feelings of being lost. I wanted the photos to cut into one another so that the viewer can see the collision of these worlds that the photgrapher has created.</p>

        <h2>Michigan in Color</h2>
        <div class="graphic">
            <img src="css/resources/images/holding_onto_and_letting_go.jpg" alt="Michelanglo's 'Hands of God and Adam', laid on top of a blue gradient and anime-inspired water">
            <p tabindex=0>This was my favorite article I wrote for Michigan in Color, and it was also my last narrative piece I published in the newspaper. I decided I wanted to make the graphic a collage in order to encapsulate some of the themes I discussed in the article about the complexities of love as a queer person of color. First, I created a blue gradient and overlaid a painting of 90s anime inspired water, because both anime and water play a large part in the content of the work. On top of that, I placed a cut out of the hands of God and Adam from Michelanglo’s painting “The Creation of Adam.” I wanted to include this painting because hands and the sensation of touch play a large part in the narrative. The painting itself was also significant because modern discussion of european often comes back to queer themes and speculation. The parental relationship between God and Adam in the Bible was also important to me because my article discusses the strain that queerness exudes on familial relationships. I wove not only the visual, but the historical elements of the work in order to create a collage that was not only visually appealing but also contextually nuanced.</p>

        <div class="graphic">
            <img src="css/resources/images/beyond_face_value.jpg" alt="A robotic face on top of a background with green binary strings">
            <p tabindex=0>The facial structure of the head at the center of this graphic was taken from a model of what is supposed to be the “ideal male face.” I chose to portray this face as robotic, inspired by the robots from the 1984 movie “The Terminator,” since the article is directly criticizing the tech industry. Fun fact: the binary numbers that appear in the background are actually the first paragraph of the article when translated from binary to english characters.</p>
