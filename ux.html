          <h1>UX Design</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="subtitle">
          <p>I started my UX design education in August 2022, and in such a short time I really fell in love with the web development process. For now, my sole project is this very website, which I coded from scratch during a web development and accessibility class in the Fall 2022 semester. I aim to continue creating personal projects in the near future! The link to the github repository for this website can be found <a href="https://github.com/andyjknakamura/portfolio">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Sketch</h2>
        <p>I started wireframing my website by hand, deciding which pages I wanted to include. The assignment soecifications for this project were to make use of the grid and flexbox layouts in CSS and to set media breakpoints for mobile and desktop viewing, so I ensured that the layouts of the pages could be designed with either model and decided to give breakpoints to the Graphics and Writing pages, as those had the most content. I also wanted each subpage to have a cohesive theme, I made the headings and navigation bars standard across all of them except for the home page, which I wanted to stand out from the rest.</p>

        <h2>Figma</h2>
        <p>After I had a rough idea of what I was aiming to create, I used Figma to create a more detailed layout of the page. I decided to add links to my resume and LinkedIn account on the Home page, as well as adding an active element to the navigation bar so that it is always clear which page the user is currently viewing. I also made some layout adjustments to the UX page, as the photos in my initial sketch were horizontal, when a vertical frame seemed to fit the content better.</p>

    <h2>Feature Highlights</h2>
    <p>Once I had started coding the website, I began to add in a few more features, such as a sticky navigation bar and a "Back to Top" button for easier navigation around the site. I also gave the navigation hover elements for ease of access. I also made sure to include alt text for the images on the pages so that screenreader users can still obtain context for the images I describe on the Graphics and UX pages. Per the requirements of the assignment, I was able to use a myriad of CSS modeling formats and created distinct mobile and desktop layouts for the pages.</p>
    <h2>Post-project Reflection</h2>
    <p>Planning, designing, and coding my first website reminded me of the most fulfilling parts of my past work as a layout designer. It is always exhilirating to take a blank page and imbue it with life. Of course, there is still so much I can add to this website, but what sets UX design apart from print layouts is that I have the capability to continue adding more content. I cannot wait to keep thinking of new ideas and improving upon my work!</p>
